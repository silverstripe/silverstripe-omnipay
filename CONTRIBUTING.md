# Contributing Guidelines

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition(s) or bug fix(es).
* Add tests for it. **This is important** so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Run `phpcs` to ensure your code is compliant with silverstripe coding guidelines.
* Commit seperate modifications as seperate branches, and separate pull requests.
* Please squash each branch you create into a single commit. This keeps things tidy.
* Ensure your code is nicely formatted according to the SilverStripe [coding conventions](http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/trunk/misc/coding-conventions).
* Send the pull request(s). Generally you can submit against the master branch.
* Check that the CI build passed. If not, rinse and repeat.
