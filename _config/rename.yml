# You can define custom names globally, or on a per gateway basis, if you define your gateway here, it will take priority
# and then will fall back to any of the global renames defined below (if set). The example below shows how you would rename
# the default fields for the Stripe payment gateway, and how to rename field names globally

#SilverStripe\Omnipay\GatewayFieldsFactory:
#  rename:
#    prefix: '' # e.g "card_"
#    name: 'myName'
#    type: 'myType'
#    number: 'myNumber'
#    Stripe:
#      name: 'name' # e.g change to newName
#      number: 'myStripeNumber'
